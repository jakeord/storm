Storm Creative Front-End developer task
 
This developer task is broken up into two main stages where we would like to see how you structure your code, displaying an example of your level of HTML, CSS and Javascript and how you tackle a given task. It gives you a great opportunity to show off your skills. Once the task has been completed please push up to your github repository and send an email with the link for review. This given task should take no longer than 1.5 hours.
 
Key requirements:

-	Use HTML, CSS (Preferably SASS) and Javascript (jQuery)
-	Use Storm Creative branded colours (where applicable)
-	Use the ‘Montserrat’ web font
-	Add a placeholder and rounded corners to input fields
-	Responsive build working from mobile first devices to desktop
-	Bonus: Use BEM syntax for CSS class names
 
Stage breakdown:

1.	The creation of a responsive fullscreen header using the provided image
2.	Adding a modal window with a form for users to sign up to updates (They won’t actually sign up to anything)
 
Stage 1:
 
Using the provided image create a responsive fullscreen header which includes a h1 of “Storm Front-End test” and a styled signup button underneath. This needs to be checked on all device widths showing changes at certain breakpoints.
 
Stage 2:
 
Once stage 1 has been completed use the styled signup button to initiate a popup on a user click. This modal window should include two input fields one for a users’ name and the other their email address along with a submit button. The form does not need to submit but a user does need the ability to close the form. How you choose to close the form is entirely down to you.
